## Enviroment - TMUX

I like to simplify my life with tools I am used to. TMUX is one of them.


### 1. [tmux-vic](https://github.com/cyb3rdog/vector-oskr-notes/blob/main/scripts/tmux-vic)

Copy the file to your favorite location, i.e. ```sudo cp ./tmux-vic /usr/local/bin```

Use the vector session by calling ```tmux-vic```; detach using ```tmux detach```, or [Ctrl+B], [d]



### 2. [tmux-dev](https://github.com/cyb3rdog/vector-oskr-notes/blob/main/scripts/tmux-dev)

Copy the file to your favorite location, i.e. ```sudo cp ./tmux-dev /usr/local/bin```

Use the vector session by calling ```tmux-dev```; detach using ```tmux detach```, or [Ctrl+B], [d]
